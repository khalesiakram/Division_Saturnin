# Division_Saturnin
Integral analysis of Saturnin based on conventional bit based division property

Execute the main.py and enter the target number of rounds as well as the number of active bits in the input.
This way, the function SolveModel() will be executed in which all possible division property with the consecutive active bits (equals to the entered number of active bits) will be assigned to the initial division property and the feasibility of its propagation to the unit vector corresponding to the target output bit will be checked.
